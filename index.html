      - You are not coding.
      - I'm playing Ghosts of Tsushima. You like it? I just bought it.
      - When was the last time you wrote some code?
      - Since I started working IT.
      - Maybe you don't have anything to code anymore. Look, I marked here several possible jobs for you.
      - I don't need you to find me a job, I'm fine like this. I make websites.
      - What kind of job is it to 'make websites'? Where does it say 'Front-end developer wanted. Good remuneration' here?
